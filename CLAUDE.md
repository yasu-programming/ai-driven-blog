# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-driven blog project that is currently in its initial setup phase. The repository contains only a basic README.md file and git initialization.

## Current State

- Project name: ai-driven-blog
- Repository is initialized with git
- No build system, dependencies, or source code present yet
- No package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency files
- No testing framework configured
- No linting or formatting tools configured

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project with no existing structure, the technology stack and build tools have not been established yet. Future development will need to:

1. Choose a technology stack (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.)
2. Set up package management and dependencies
3. Configure build and development tools
4. Establish project structure and architecture

## Notes for Future Development

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated once the project structure and development workflow are established to include:
- Build commands
- Test execution commands  
- Linting and formatting commands
- Project architecture details
- Development workflow instructions
